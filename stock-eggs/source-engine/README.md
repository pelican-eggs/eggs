# Source-Engine

The Source Dedicated Server or SRCDS is a tool that runs the server component of a Source game without the client component. In other words, it simulates the game without drawing it.

This also covers games that are installed using the steamcmd utility.

### Server Ports
Many of these servers will require the steam query ports to be open for the server.
The default steam query port is 27015

## ARK Survival Evolved

### Port Requirements
The ARK server requires 4 ports minimum.

| Port    | default |
|---------|---------|
| Game    | 7777    |
| Game +1 | 7778    |
| Query   | 27015   |
| RCON    | 27020   |

Please note the server may not show up on steam game server lists due to this requirement if all ports are not set/added.
