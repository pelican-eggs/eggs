# OpenRA Tiberian Dawn

#### The classic command & conquer Server


#### from the developers
OpenRA is a project that recreates and modernizes the classic Command & Conquer real time strategy games. We have developed a flexible open source game engine (the OpenRA engine) that provides a common platform for rebuilding and reimagining classic 2D and 2.5D RTS games (the OpenRA mods).

This means that OpenRA is not restricted by the technical limitations of the original closed-source games: it includes native support for modern operating systems and screen resolutions (including Windows 10, macOS, and most Linux distros) without relying on emulation or binary hacks, and features integrated online multiplayer.

OpenRA requires a single port  

| Port    | default |
|---------|---------|
| Game    | 5500    |

#### Mods/Plugins may require ports to be added to the server.
