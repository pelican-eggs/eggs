You need to open these ports before running the server `7777, 7778, 7779, 7780, 7781`. They are require for RCON, seeing your servr on the list and etc.

### Notes

<!--Notes about the server ports.-->
`7777` is the default port, but any port can be used.
You need to assign to network port `7779` if you want to use RCON
Also you need to open port `7778` and `7781` for the query, so it can appear on the server list.
`7780` is Stats port.

`7777, 7781` open for UDP
`7778, 7779, 7780` both protocols
