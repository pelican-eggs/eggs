# Crucible
Crucible is a Thermos with several improvements. We aim to close the gaps left by Thermos and extend the support for those still on 1.7.10 by adding support for long broken mods and plugins and fix serious bugs as they appear.

## Server Ports

The minecraft server requires a single port for access (default 25565) but plugins may require extra ports to enabled for the server.

| Port  | default |
|-------|---------|
| Game  | 25565   |

## Notes
By default the downloaded version is `latest`, versions must follow the pattern `vX.X` or `staging-XXXXX` for branch builds
