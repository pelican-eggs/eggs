# Spigot

A high performance Minecraft server implementation

## Server Ports
The minecraft server requires a single port for access (default 25565) but plugins may require extra ports to enabled for the server.


| Port  | default |
|-------|---------|
| Game  | 25565   |

## Server Specific

Spigot was hit with a DMCA and now requires that it be built by the user.

You can also supply a download link to a server jar if you want.
